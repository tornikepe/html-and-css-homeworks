                Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG, Insta or the gram) is an American
                photo and video sharing social networking service created by Kevin Systrom 
                and Mike Krieger. In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately 
                US$1 billion in cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be
                edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be
                shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by
                tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users 
                to add their content to a personal feed.
