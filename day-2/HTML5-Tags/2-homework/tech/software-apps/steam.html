                Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve. It was launched 
                as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide
                automatic updates for their games, and expanded to include games from third-party 
                publishers. Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront.
                Steam offers digital rights management (DRM), server hosting, video streaming, and social
                networking services. It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, 
                and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud storage, and in-game voice and chat functionality.
