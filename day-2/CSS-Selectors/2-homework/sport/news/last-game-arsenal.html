                he history of Arsenal Football Club from 1966 to the present day covers
                the third, fourth, and fifth periods
                of success in Arsenal's history
                including three Doubles, a Cup Double, and success in European football.
                Following Bertie Mee's appointment in 1966, Arsenal won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup,
                their first European trophy, in 1969–70, and their first League and FA Cup double in 1970–71.
                The Double-winning side, however, was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised
                by a series of near misses: Arsenal lost three FA Cup finals (1971–72, 1977–78, and 1979–80) and the
                1979–80 Cup Winners' Cup final on penalties.
                The club's only success during this time was an FA Cup win in 1978–79 against Manchester United.
