            Dinamo Tbilisi was one of the most prominent clubs in Soviet football and a major
            contender in the Soviet Top League almost immediately after it was established in 1936.
            The club was then part of one of the leading sport societies in the Soviet Union, the 
            All-Union Dynamo sports society which had several other divisions besides football and was
            sponsored by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs. Its main claim to European 
            fame was winning the Cup Winners' Cup in 1981, beating FC Carl Zeiss Jena of East
            Germany 2–1 in the final in Düsseldorf. It remains the only club based in Georgia to have ever
            lifted a trophy in European competition. Throughout its history, FC Dinamo Tbilisi
            produced many famous Soviet players: Boris Paichadze, Avtandil Gogoberidze, Shota Iamanidze,
            Mikheil Meskhi, Slava Metreveli, Murtaz Khurtsilava, Manuchar Machaidze, David Kipiani,
            Vladimir Gutsaev, Aleksandre Chivadze, Vitaly Daraselia, Ramaz Shengelia, and Tengiz Sulakvelidze. After
            the break-up of the Soviet Union, it would later produce some of the finest Georgian players such as 
            Temur Ketsbaia, Shota Arveladze, Giorgi Kinkladze, Kakha Kaladze, and Levan Kobiashvili.
